# SiHi language compiler
This directory contains the SiHi grammar description
due yacc & flex. SiHi is a wide subset of famous ANSI C89
programming language:
- there is no 'register' memory class
- there are only two types: real & void

The language is untrivial and it really provides
you structures, unions, enums and other C's features.

# Urgently TODO
Make parse able to generate syntax tree. Test 
tree generator with DotViz.
After that, remove DotViz unit test for this and leave only
tree generation.
