# LLCCEP

This Low-Level Code Compilation and Execution Platform is an LLVM-like, but simpled a some.
It now supports only assembly language compilation to binary files. The syntax is
ARM-like, but instruction set is reduced a some. The language is more flexible than
Intel or AT&T assembly. 
The changes between ARM and LLCCEP assembly:
- Register's indication begins with '&' character, not 'r'
- There are only 7 conditions
- There are no branches.
